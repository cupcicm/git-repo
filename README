This is a fork of the android repo tool, that has three major differences 
with the official sources :
* It should work on Windows. The most basic operations work, but I couldn't
check them all. It works only on later versions of Windows (Vista and later).
You need to run with administrative privileges because that's the only way you 
can create symlinks on windows.
* All symlinks are absolute (while they are relative in the official repo). That
means you will probably find it really hard to move a repo with this version.
* This tool still depends on a linux-like environment, with a shell, etc. : You 
will need to use either cygwin or git-bash.

This is definitely not a very polished version, for which I unfortunately don't
have time now. I am definitely interested in pull requests if you fix or clean things.
